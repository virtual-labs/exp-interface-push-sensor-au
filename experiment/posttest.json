  {
    "question": "In this experiment, how can you change which GPIO pin the LED uses?",
    "answers": {
      "a": "By changing the wiring and updating the code",
      "b": "By pressing the button twice",
      "c": "By rebooting the Raspberry Pi",
      "d": "It cannot be changed"

    "difficulty": "Intermediate"
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is it important to configure the GPIO pin mode in the Python program?",
    "answers": {
      "a": "To set the pin as input or output correctly",
      "b": "To reduce CPU usage",
      "c": "To improve LED brightness",
      "d": "To enable Wi-Fi communication"
    },

    "difficulty": "Intermediate"
  },
  {
    "question": "When the button is pressed, what happens to the input pinâ€™s voltage?",
    "answers": {
      "a": "It stays at 0V",
      "b": "It changes from LOW to HIGH (or vice versa)",
      "c": "It starts oscillating",
      "d": "It turns into an analog signal"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "b",
    "difficulty": "Easy"
  },
  {
    "question": "What will happen if the push button wiring is reversed in the circuit?",
    "answers": {
      "a": "The LED will never turn ON",
      "b": "It may still work depending on connection to ground or VCC",
      "c": "It will damage the Raspberry Pi",
      "d": "The button will act as an analog sensor"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "b",
    "difficulty": "Intermediate"
  },
  {
    "question": "How does the Python program continuously check the button state?",
    "answers": {
      "a": "By using a loop that reads the GPIO input pin repeatedly",
      "b": "By sending an interrupt signal to the Pi",
      "c": "By only reading the pin once at startup",
      "d": "By using Wi-Fi polling"
    },
