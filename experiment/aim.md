## Aim of the Experiment

The goal of this experiment is to interface a push button with a Raspberry Pi and develop a Python program to control an LED based on the buttonâ€™s state. The LED will turn ON when the button is pressed. This experiment serves as the foundation for applications in home automation, security, and environmental monitoring.


### Applications of the Push Button and LED Control System

1. **Home Automation**: Automate lighting and devices based on user input or environmental conditions (e.g., motion sensors turning lights ON).
2. **Security Systems**: Trigger alerts or alarms based on sensor input (e.g., door/window sensors triggering LEDs or sirens).
3. **Environmental Monitoring**: Adjust systems based on sensor data (e.g., light sensors controlling room lighting).
4. **Interactive Systems**: Use buttons to control devices or cycle through different modes (e.g., turning a fan ON/OFF).
5. **Prototype Development**: Build IoT, robotics, or interactive prototypes with input from buttons or sensors.
6. **Educational Tools**: Teach hardware interaction and control in introductory electronics and programming courses.
