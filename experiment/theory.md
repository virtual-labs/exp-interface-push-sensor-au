### Theory

We'll demonstrate how to attach a basic push button to the Raspberry Pi and how to accept input from the device's GPIO pins. It's very simple to connect a push button to a Raspberry Pi, and the experiments goal is to comprehend the ideas underlying the interface. The Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins are a crucial component since they allow the device to communicate with external physical components like motors, buttons, and LEDs.

* Mini Breadboard

* Connecting Wires

* Power Supply

Raspberry Pi - A single-board computer the size of a credit card called the Raspberry Pi enables users of all computing skills to experiment with and learn about computation. Other pieces of peripheral gear, including a keyboard, mouse, and monitor, can be connected to the minicomputer. You will require an SD card placed into the designated location in order to configure the Raspberry computer. The operating system should be placed on the SD card, which is necessary for the machine to boot. Linux OS is compatible with Raspberry computers.  
The Raspberry Pi's row of GPIO pins at the top edge of the board is one of its strong points. General-Purpose Input/Output, or GPIO. The Raspberry Pi connects to the outside world physically using these pins. You can think of them as switches at their most basic level, which you can turn on or off (input), or which the Pi can turn on or off (output). The Raspberry Pi runs 5V volts. The Raspberry Pi can monitor and control the outside world by connecting to electronic circuits via the GPIO pins. The Pi can operate motors, turn LEDs on and off, and do a lot of other things. It can also determine the temperature, light, and whether a switch has been touched. The Raspberry Pi has 40 pins (26 pins on early variants), and they serve a variety of roles. Knowing what each pin is used for is much easier if you have a RasPiO pin label. Make sure your pin label is positioned so that the keyring hole is directed outward toward the USB ports.
