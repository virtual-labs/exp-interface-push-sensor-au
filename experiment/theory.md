### Theory

This experiment demonstrates the process of interfacing a basic push button with a Raspberry Pi and utilizing its General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) pins to receive input signals. Connecting a push button to a Raspberry Pi is straightforward, and the objective of this experiment is to explore and understand the principles underlying hardware interfacing. The GPIO pins are a critical feature of the Raspberry Pi, enabling seamless communication between the device and external hardware components such as buttons, LEDs, motors, and sensors.

The Raspberry Pi leverages its GPIO pins to interact with the physical world, functioning as programmable switches that can be configured as inputs (to detect external signals) or outputs (to control connected devices). By integrating a push button and an LED in this setup, the experiment illustrates fundamental concepts of digital input processing and output control, laying the groundwork for more complex applications in embedded systems and automation.

Raspberry Pi -The Raspberry Pi is a credit-card-sized single-board computer designed to promote computational experimentation and education for users of all skill levels. It supports peripheral devices such as a keyboard, mouse, and monitor, transforming it into a fully functional computing platform. To operate, the Raspberry Pi requires a micro SD card inserted into its designated slot, with an operating system (typically a Linux distribution like Raspberry Pi OS) installed on the card to facilitate booting.

One of the Raspberry Pi’s standout features is its row of GPIO pins, located along the top edge of the board. GPIO, or General Purpose Input/Output, refers to these versatile pins that enable physical interaction with external electronic components. Operating at 3.3V logic levels (though the board is powered by 5V), the GPIO pins can be programmed to serve as inputs (e.g., detecting a button press) or outputs (e.g., activating an LED). This capability allows the Raspberry Pi to monitor environmental conditions—such as light intensity, temperature, or switch states—and control devices like motors, LEDs, and relays.
